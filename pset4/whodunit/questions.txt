1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library which is useful for embedded programming which often involves considerable manipulation of hardware specific I/O registers.
2.  It clearly specifies in what way you want to use the data.
    uint8_t is same as unsigned char and is equal to 1 byte or 8 bits.
    uint16_t is same as unsigned short and is equal to 2 bytes or 16 bits.
    uint32_t is same as unsigned int and is equal to 4 bytes or 32 bits.
    int32_t is same as signed int and is equal to 4 bytes or 32 bits.
3.  BYTE - 1 byte or 8 bits
    DWORD - 4 bytes or 32 bits
    LONG - 4 bytes or 32 bits
    WORD - 2 bytes of 16 bits
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must be hexadecimal.
5.  bfSize is included under a structure named BITMAPFILEHEADER and specifies the size of BMP file in bytes.
    biSize is included under a structure named BITMAPINFOHEADER and specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth (bits per pixels).
8.  If it can not open the input or the output file it returns NULL.
9.  The third argument is always 1 because it ensures only 1 object to be read at a time.
10. 3.
11. fseek() function is used to move file pointer position to the given location.
12. It moves file pointer position to given location.
